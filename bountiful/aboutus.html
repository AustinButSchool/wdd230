                Austin, two friends with a shared passion for health and wellness, embarked on a mission to
                revolutionize the smoothie industry. Inspired by the abundance of fresh, locally-sourced produce
                available in the region, they envisioned a vibrant space where people could come together to nourish
                their bodies and delight their taste buds. In 2010, their dream became a reality when they opened the
